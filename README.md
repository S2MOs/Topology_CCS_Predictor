# Topology_CCS_Predictor
Data and notebooks for "Classifying host-guest topology with ion mobility spectrometry and machine learning"

### In this repository
- Experimental CCS data
- DFT inputs and outputs for the diamines included in the chemical space
- Jupyter notebooks for generating DFT inputs, processing and parsing the DFT data and training a regression model for predicting the CCS and topology of host-guest complexes
